**Version 1.0.4** - *March ??, 2024*:
- Fixed a potential buffer overflow when displaying an error message on Windows.

**Version 1.0.3** - *February 29th, 2024*:
- Input parsing no longer breaks if the `char` type is unsiged on a C implementation.
- Compilation should no longer fail now if the function `__fpurge()` is not available on the target Linux system.
- Moved the check of if the terminal is big enough to right after its size is obtained (previously it was made a little later, which could result in dereferencing a `NULL` pointer).
- Check for zero size when allocating memory.
- Check if any dimension is zero when allocating a 2D array.
- On Linux, the pseudo-random number generator now seeds itself when it runs for the first time (on Windows, that already happened).

**Version 1.0.1** - *February 27th, 2024*:

- The game over screen now waits for 0.75 seconds before taking any input to exit the game.
